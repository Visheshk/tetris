#Tetris for programs

##What is this?
It's a game of Tetris, ideally to be played by programs.

##Why?
Just Because.

- Playing Tetris is an NP-Hard problem from what I've heard
- Doesn't that make you obviously want to sit, make a tetras playing algorithm, and see how much better yours is compared to others? That's why.

##How?
So I'm trying to make a wrapper of a program, which somebody else can call, execute the main function in a loop (no idea how exactly this should work), and at every step of the loop, learn about the status of the board, falling piece and everything, and make one of the four translation/rotation (left, right, drop, rotate) moves that can be done.
